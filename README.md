📊 Summary applications of a portfolio analysis for an example B2B company

This part is showing how a B2B company (business that sells to other businesses) can use portfolio analysis to decide which information systems should get more attention, money, and resources.

Think of it like sorting your tools into:

must-have now and later

nice to have in the future

only for now

low priority



---

🧩 How it works in this example:

They look at each system and ask:

1. Is it important now? (Current strategic importance)


2. Will it become more important in the future? (Future strategic importance)



Then, they put each system into a box on the chart:

Quadrant	Meaning	Example systems (from the slide)

Strategic (Attack)	High importance now and future — invest and improve aggressively.	Procurement system, stock control system, distribution systems.
High potential (Beware)	Not critical now, but will be very important soon — plan and prepare.	E-commerce system, electronic catalogue, CRM (customer intelligence) systems.
Key operational (Explore)	Important now, but not in the future — keep running but don’t invest too much.	Production line systems.
Support (Safe)	Low importance now and future — just keep them working.	HR systems, finance systems.



---

✅ Why this matters:

This helps the company:

Focus on systems that will help them compete.

Avoid wasting money on systems that won’t bring future value.

Plan upgrades where they will really matter.

See digital opportunities clearly.



---

📝 In short:

> It’s a simple but powerful way for a B2B company to see which digital tools will support its strategy best — now and in the future.



If you'd like, I can also make a quick real-world example to show how this works. Want me to do that?

.......
Sure — let’s break this down step by step, using simple language.


---

📊 What this part is saying:

It explains how a B2B company might use portfolio analysis to decide which systems are more important for the future.


---

✅ Point 1:

> Applications such as human resources, financial management and production-line management systems will continue to support the operations of the business and will not be a priority for future investment.



Meaning:
These systems (HR, finance, production management):

Are necessary for daily work.

Will keep running to support business operations.

But the company doesn’t need to spend a lot to upgrade or innovate them, because they won’t help the company stand out from competitors.


They are like the “support (safe)” or “key operational (explore)” parts of the portfolio — keep them, but don’t invest heavily.


---

✅ Point 2:

> In contrast, to achieve competitive advantage, applications for maintaining a dynamic customer catalogue online, online sales and collecting marketing intelligence about customer buying behavior will become more important.



Meaning:
To get ahead of competitors and grow, the company should focus on:

Customer catalogue online — making it dynamic and always updated.

Online sales systems — selling products/services online.

Marketing intelligence systems — tools that track what customers buy, like, or search.


These systems help the company:

Reach more customers.

Sell more.

Better understand customer needs. And this will bring real competitive advantage.


They belong in the “strategic (attack)” or “high potential (beware)” parts of the portfolio — where the company should invest more.


---

✅ Point 3:

> Applications such as procurement and logistics will continue to be of importance in an e-business context.



Meaning:
Systems that manage:

Procurement (buying materials, supplies).

Logistics (moving products to customers, delivery).


These will stay important because:

They help reduce costs.

They improve speed and efficiency.

They support online business by making sure products get to customers reliably.


These stay in the “strategic (attack)” part — the company should keep investing to keep them effective.


---

📝 In short:

> The company uses portfolio analysis to see which systems are just needed to keep running (support), and which systems can help win in the market (strategic).
Then, they can focus investment on the systems that bring future competitive advantage.



If you'd like, I can also draw a simple table or diagram to show this visually. Want me to?

....
Sure! Let’s look at both slides step by step in plain language.


---

📦 First slide: Porter's Five Forces

This is a classic tool used in strategic analysis to understand the competition a business faces.

It helps answer: What outside forces might affect how successful our business can be?

Here are the five forces:

Force	What it means

Bargaining power of customers	Can customers easily demand lower prices or better quality?
Bargaining power of suppliers	Can suppliers raise prices or limit supply?
Threat of substitutes	Are there other products/services that could replace ours?
Threat of new entrants	How easy is it for new companies to enter the market and compete?
Extent of rivalry between competitors	How intense is the competition among existing companies?


Why use it?
By understanding these forces, a business can:

See where it is strong or weak.

Plan how to defend against competitive threats.

Find opportunities to stand out.



---

📊 Second slide: Matrix for evaluation of external capability against internal capability

This is another analysis tool to help decide what digital strategy a company should follow.

The matrix uses two axes:

Internal capability/incentives (vertical): How ready and willing is the company to adopt digital tools?

External forces/incentives (horizontal): How much pressure or opportunity is there from the market, competitors, or customers to go digital?


Together, these create four strategic options:

Quadrant	When to use	What to do

Market Driving Strategy	Internal readiness is high, but market pressure is low	Educate and motivate customers to create demand.
Market Driven Strategy	Both internal readiness and market pressure are high	Move quickly to keep up with opportunities and threats.
Capability Building	Internal readiness is low, but market pressure is high	Focus on improving internal skills, systems, and processes to catch up.
Status Quo: Don’t bother	Both internal readiness and market pressure are low	Do nothing special for now; no immediate need to change.



---

📝 In plain words:

Porter’s Five Forces helps the business see what outside competition and pressures it faces.

The matrix helps decide if the business should:

Lead the market by educating customers.

Keep up with strong external demand.

Focus inside to get ready.

Or do nothing if there's no need.



These tools help make smart decisions about where to invest in digital strategy.


---

If you'd like, I can also: ✅ Draw a simple sketch,
✅ Give a real example,
✅ Or explain why each strategy fits its box.

//////////////////
 natural small talk examples using the phrase "in order to..."-> https://chatgpt.com/share/6864d7af-b3fc-8004-acf0-6edfd41f97c5

Great choice! You're building **professional fluency** fast. Now let's add another formal and **very useful structure**, especially in written communication at work:

---

## ✅ Structure: **“In order to…”**

(= to explain the **purpose** of an action clearly and professionally)

---

### 💡 Meaning:

Use **“in order to”** to say **why** you're doing something — it sounds more formal than just “to.”

---

### 🔧 Structure:

> **In order to + base verb, + result**
> or
> **Subject + verb + in order to + base verb**

---

### ✅ Examples:

1. **In order to meet the deadline, we worked overtime.**

2. **She attended the training in order to improve her skills.**

3. **We created this report in order to clarify the process.**

4. **In order to reduce errors, please double-check your entries.**

---

### 🧠 Bonus Tip:

You can also use:

* **So that + subject + verb**
  👉 *“We worked overtime so that we could meet the deadline.”*

---

### ✍️ Try it!

Write a sentence using **“in order to…”** to explain a purpose — maybe something you do at work or school.

Then we can level up with:

* **Formal conditionals** (e.g., *If I were in your position...*)
* **Passive voice for reports** (*The project was completed by the team.*)
* Or phrases for **meetings, reports, and presentations**

Just say the word: **“Move on”** 💬📈

Great! Let’s practice a **workplace conversation** using **“Would you mind...?”** in a natural, professional tone.

---

### 🗂️ **Example Workplace Situation: Team Meeting Preparation**

**Scenario**: You're preparing for a team meeting tomorrow. You need help from a colleague named Sarah.

---

#### 🧑‍💼 You:

Hi Sarah, would you mind helping me prepare the slides for tomorrow's meeting?

#### 👩‍💼 Sarah:

Sure, I can help. What exactly do you need?

#### 🧑‍💼 You:

Would you mind reviewing the financial data section? I want to make sure everything is accurate.

#### 👩‍💼 Sarah:

No problem. Do you want me to add any comments?

#### 🧑‍💼 You:

Yes, please. And would you mind sending it back to me before 4 PM?

#### 👩‍💼 Sarah:

Of course! I’ll get started right away.

---

### 🗣️ Let’s Make It Interactive

I’ll be your coworker. Try saying something using **“Would you mind...?”**, and I’ll respond like a real conversation.

👉 Go ahead and type your first sentence!

//////////
Awesome! Let's build on that with another **very professional structure** — one you’ll often see in **emails, meetings, and business communication**:

---

## ✅ Structure: **“I’d appreciate it if you could…”**

(= a polite and formal way to ask someone to do something)

---

### 💡 Why it’s useful:

* **More polite and respectful** than saying “Can you…”
* Ideal for **requests** in work emails or team discussions
* Sounds professional without being too formal

---

### 🔧 Structure:

> **I’d appreciate it if you could + base verb...**

---

### ✅ Examples:

1. **I’d appreciate it if you could send me the final draft by Friday.**

2. **I’d appreciate it if you could confirm your attendance.**

3. **I’d appreciate it if you could review the attached file.**

4. **I’d appreciate it if you could keep me updated on the progress.**

---

### 🧠 Quick Tip:

You can also say:

* **“I would be grateful if you could…”** *(a bit more formal)*
* **“Please let me know if you’re available to…”**

---

### ✍️ Try it!

Write a sentence using:

> **I’d appreciate it if you could...**

Then I’ll help refine it for perfect workplace tone.

When you’re ready, I can move on to:

* **Conditionals for business** (e.g. “If you could...”)
* **“In order to…”** for explaining purpose
* **Passive voice in formal emails**
  Just say: **“Move on”** 💼📩
